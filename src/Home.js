import React from "react";

      <p>
        The first thing to be aware of is the presence of a handful of new Data
        APIs that only work on routes defined via the new data routers (i.e.,
        createBrowserRouter). These include a few categories of APIs:
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Home;
